# 🗄️ ARCHIVED - Prismatica

A fun experiment that merges multiple Prisma schema files into a single consolidated schema using regex parsing.

## Why Archived?

This was built just for the challenge and to see if it could be done with regex. Turns out regex has its limitations for parsing complex schema structures - who would have thought? 😄

## What It Does

Takes modular Prisma schema files and combines them into one. Dependency-free, regex-powered, and probably not production-ready.
